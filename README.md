# hello-world

Pay my respects to GitHub community.

Hi,

Rebecca here, this is my first technical blog after work in IT world for 10 years from a non computer background. I started to create my own script not long ago. And i will throw them here and maybe review it sometime later. I do not expected this blog to be observed, and I want to keep it as my own treasure. If you happen to passby & see my naive code, please tolerate with it. :)
